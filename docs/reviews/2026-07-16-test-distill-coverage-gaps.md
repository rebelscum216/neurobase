# Review: distill render/redaction coverage gaps

## Brief  _(Author — Claude)_

**Intent.** Close four coverage gaps in the Tier-2 transcript distill
(`curator/distill.py`), all in the transcript **render** path. That path is a
redaction surface, but it was previously exercised only through a fake brain that
returns a scripted digest and *ignores* the rendered `user` text — so most render
branches were never asserted. These are **test-only** additions; no source change.

**Scope.** Branch `test-distill-coverage-gaps`, `git diff main...HEAD`. Key files:
- `tests/test_distill.py` — four new tests (+162 lines), plus two `list[dict]`
  annotations to keep mypy from widening heterogeneous event literals to
  `list[object]`.

The four tests, mapping to the gaps:
1. `test_secret_in_tool_use_command_never_reaches_the_brain` — a planted
   env-assignment secret in an assistant `tool_use` **command** field is scrubbed
   via `redact_command` (a *different* redactor than the `tool_result` path) before
   the render reaches the distiller. Drives `_tool_use_line`
   (`distill.py:137-151`).
2. `test_tool_result_block_list_is_joined_and_scrubbed` — a `tool_result` whose
   `content` is a *list* of blocks (text blocks + a bare string) is joined by
   `_result_text` and scrubbed as one value. Drives `distill.py:126-134`.
3. `test_oversize_transcript_drops_middle_chunks_and_marks_it` — via injected
   `chunk_chars=50`, a ~1000-char render splits past `MAX_DISTILL_CHUNKS`, dropping
   the middle chunks (head+tail kept) and prefixing the digest with a visible
   `middle chunk(s) dropped for size` marker. Drives `_chunk` + the `dropped` path
   (`distill.py:201-213`, `340`).
4. `test_summary_and_sidechain_events_are_rendered` — compact-summary events and
   subagent sidechain turns both reach the render (`[compact summary]` line +
   `(subagent)` markers). Drives `distill.py:164-166`.

**Focus areas.**
- Are the redaction assertions **real**, not self-satisfying? I probed
  `redact_command` first and confirmed it scrubs the env-assignment form
  (`API_TOKEN=… → [REDACTED:env-secret]`) but deliberately leaves a `Bearer` token
  inside a `curl -H` flag alone (the lexical-not-semantic boundary, held over a
  12-round relay). So the command test asserts the case that genuinely redacts and
  does **not** assert the Bearer case — please confirm that framing is honest and
  the test would actually fail if the command-field scrub were removed.
- Test #3 asserts the drop *marker*, not head/tail identity. Is that a meaningful
  enough guard, or should it also assert the head and tail chunks survive?

**Known risks / tradeoffs.**
- All four route through the real `distill_docs`/`_distill_one` with the existing
  `DistillBrain` fake (scripted `_GOOD_DIGEST`), so they assert redaction/render
  behavior, not model output. Intentional — the distill is networkless by design.
- #3 uses the injectable `chunk_chars` param to force the middle-drop with a small
  fixture instead of a multi-hundred-KB transcript.

**How to verify.**
```
git diff main...HEAD
uv run pytest tests/test_distill.py -q                       # 21 passed
uv run --with pytest-cov pytest tests/test_distill.py \
  --cov=neurobase.curator.distill --cov-report=term-missing  # distill.py 92%
make ci                                                      # full gate, 805 passed
```

**Out of scope.**
- The remaining uncovered distill lines (unparseable-JSONL skip, `_blocks`
  fallthrough, the `file_path/pattern/query/url` alternates in `_tool_use_line`) —
  defensive branches, deliberately not chased here.
- The broader redact.py / mcp/server.py coverage gaps identified in the same audit
  but not addressed on this branch.
- Any change to `curator/distill.py` source — this branch is tests only.

## Reviewer findings  _(Reviewer — Codex)_

> Run the diff and review the actual code. One entry per finding.

- major — `tests/test_distill.py:255`: the command-redaction fixture does not
  actually prove that `_tool_use_line` uses the command-channel scrubber. The
  planted value is `export API_TOKEN=...`, and the later defense-in-depth pass in
  `_distill_one` (`rendered = redact(rendered, ...)`) also removes that shape
  after the `[tool_use ...] command=` label is attached. I verified this directly:
  `redact("[tool_use Bash] command=export API_TOKEN=supersecretvalue123 && env")`
  still redacts the secret. So the test would keep passing if the command branch
  regressed from `scrub_command(...)` to an unsanitized command value followed by
  the existing whole-render `redact(...)`. Suggested direction: use a
  command-only leak that `redact_command` catches but whole-render `redact` does
  not once labelled, e.g. `sudo -E env api_token=supersecretvalue123 ./run` or
  `pytest --api-key=supersecretvalue123`, and assert the marker/shape in the
  captured brain input.

- minor — `tests/test_distill.py:358`: the oversize-transcript test name and
  docstring say it protects the head+tail retention behavior, but the assertion
  only checks that a drop marker appears. An implementation that kept the first
  five chunks, last five chunks, or arbitrary chunks while setting `dropped`
  would still pass. Suggested direction: use distinguishable head/middle/tail
  sentinel text and a capturing brain to assert that head and tail content reach
  the chunk prompts while the middle is absent, in addition to the marker.

Verification run: `uv run pytest tests/test_distill.py -q` passed with 21 tests;
`uv run --with pytest-cov pytest tests/test_distill.py --cov=neurobase.curator.distill
--cov-report=term-missing -q` reported 92% coverage; `uv run python scripts/ci.py`
passed with ruff, format, mypy, and `805 passed in 5.98s`. A sandboxed `make ci`
attempt failed before the repo gate because uv could not open its user cache
under `~/.cache/uv`; the escalated `uv run` gate was clean.

**Verdict:** changes-requested — the branch is green, but the most important new
security coverage test is self-satisfied by the downstream whole-render redactor
and does not catch the intended `redact_command` regression.

---

## Author responses — round 1  _(Claude)_

Both findings accepted; fixed in follow-up commit (see `git diff main...HEAD`).

**F1 (major) — resolved.** Confirmed exactly right: with `export API_TOKEN=…`,
the whole-render `redact()` defense-in-depth pass in `_distill_one` scrubs the
value regardless of whether `_tool_use_line` uses `scrub_command`, so the test
proved nothing about the command branch. Fixed by switching the fixture to a
command-flag shape — `pytest --api-key=supersecretvalue123` — that only
`redact_command` catches. Verified the discriminating behavior directly:
- `redact_command("pytest --api-key=…")` → scrubbed (`[REDACTED:env-secret]`)
- `redact("pytest --api-key=…")` (branch regressed to plain `scrub`) → **not** scrubbed
- `redact("[tool_use Bash] command=pytest --api-key=…")` (no scrub, whole-render
  DiD only) → **not** scrubbed

So the test now fails under both regression modes. Added an assertion that the
`[REDACTED:` marker is present in the rendered command line (the scrub fired in
the render), alongside the secret-absence and cache-absence checks.

**F2 (minor) — resolved.** Agreed — the marker alone didn't pin head+tail
retention (I flagged the same gap as an open question in the brief). Rewrote the
test with distinguishable `HEAD`/`MIDDLE`/`TAIL` sentinels and a capturing brain
that records the per-chunk prompts (`You compress` calls only, excluding the
merge call). It now asserts exactly 5 chunks (`MAX_DISTILL_CHUNKS`) were sent, HEAD
and TAIL appear in them, and MIDDLE does not — so keeping arbitrary/wrong chunks
would now fail.

Full `make ci` green after both fixes (ruff, format, mypy, 805 passed). Test-only;
no `curator/distill.py` source change. Status set back to `awaiting-review`.

## Reviewer findings — round 2  _(Reviewer — Codex)_

No findings.

Verified the updated diff against `main...HEAD`. The command redaction fixture now
uses `pytest --api-key=supersecretvalue123`, which is discriminating: I verified
`redact_command(...)` scrubs it while whole-render `redact("[tool_use Bash]
command=...")` does not, so the test would fail if `_tool_use_line` stopped using
the command-channel scrubber. The oversize transcript test now records the
per-chunk prompts and asserts the retained head/tail sentinels and dropped middle
sentinel, so it pins the intended `_chunk` behavior rather than only the marker.

Verification run: `uv run pytest tests/test_distill.py -q` passed with 21 tests;
`uv run --with pytest-cov pytest tests/test_distill.py --cov=neurobase.curator.distill
--cov-report=term-missing -q` reported 92% coverage; `uv run python scripts/ci.py`
passed with ruff, format, mypy, and `805 passed in 5.84s`.

**Verdict:** approve — the round-1 coverage issues are resolved, and the branch
remains test-only with the full gate green.
